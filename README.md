# Tennis_Game_Prediction
Trying to predict tennis match winner via a simple neural net using pytorch and a basic XGboost
A lot of inspirationsfrom the more advanved data processing from
    https://github.com/edouardthom/ATPBetting/blob/master/Beating%20the%20bookmakers%20on%20tennis%20matches.ipynb

Data are downloaded from http://tennis-data.co.uk/data.php for matches over the past years then are merged into 1 file and processed
A Neural Net is fitted and achieves 95% accuracy on the test set
XGboost achieves a 98% accuracy on the test set
